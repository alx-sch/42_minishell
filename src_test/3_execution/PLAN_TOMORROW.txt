1. Fix Norminette errors in the file get_flags_and_command_test.c (FINISHED)
2. Do the redirections. (FINISHED)
3. Fix pipes. (FINISHED)
4. Figure out a way to make sure all child processes are actually killed in the
case of one of the previous ones not working.
5. Handle if there was a Heredoc found.

Pipes:

ls -l | grep "Makefile"

Takes the output of the first command into the pipe.
Second command uses pipe as input.

pipe_fd[0] is READ.
pipe_fd[1] is WRITE.

prev_pipe_fd[0] is PREVIOUS READ.
prev_pipe_fd[1] is PREVIOUS WRITE.

I store the previous read and write in two pointers, to get the information 
from the previous pipe.
