NOTE TO SELF:

--> I need to redefine the structs for envp_temp and export_list.
--> They should distinguish between the environmental variables and their 
values.
--> The export list might even have a "declare -x" part, that everything else
appends to.
--> This way I can easily modify values of already existing variables.
--> This way we will also easily be able to expand the environmental variables,
like $USER means nholbroo, for instance.

Some other thoughts:
--> We should definitely find a way to distinguish between "full input" and 
"builtin input". So to the parsing-function where the builtins are handled, it
only receives ONE builtin with arguments, and not the whole input string.
--> I guess we need some while-loops within some while-loops.
--> This way it doesn't mess up as there will also be other stuff in the input.
--> And also - I am guessing we expand the environmental variables outside of
the function that handles builtins. So for instance "export NAME=$USER" would
be translated BEFORE entering the builtin-part. 

NEW NOTE TO SELF:
--> Remember to fix the export with arguments, not working atm.
-- It is in the export file. You have to add to both value and e_var, as it is
not the case now, and you can also use the same function for both.

NOTE TO SELF ON JUNE 26TH:
--> Protect all mallocs!!
--> Put everything into src without comments.
--> Implement echo builtin.
