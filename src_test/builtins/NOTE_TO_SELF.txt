NOTES ABOUT CD-command:

1. If the command is "cd" and whitespaces, it should still behave as only
"cd". E.g. "cd       ".
2. Figure out how to deal with '/' properly when changing directories through
relative paths.
3. Figure out how to deal with absolute paths.
4. Figure out how to make "tab"-key autofill all the files within a directory,
when it's clicked several times.
5. Figure out how to exclude files from the "cd"-command.
6. Handle "cd -". It should go to root and also output '/'.
7. Add everything from src_test into src, to fix up the make-command as it's 
saying 5/1 - 500 % right now. Remove the documentation when it is put into 
src.
